Hey, I'm Jiangnan HUANG(黄 江南), currently a 3rd year **Ph.D.** student at [Institute of Computing and Information Sciences](https://www.ru.nl/icis/)([Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/)), Nijmegen, Netherlands, under the supervision of [Dr. Bin Lin](https://binlin.info/index.html) and [Prof. dr. Frits Vaandrager](http://www.cs.ru.nl/F.Vaandrager/). Prior to this, I was a full-time Research Engineer in [Huawei Technologies France](https://www.huawei.com/fr/). My research interests lie primarily in AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE), with a focus on DevOps, especially on the GitHub Actions CI/CD platform. Recently, I have been exploring the use of LLMs to enhance automation in GitHub Actions, aiming to improve the efficiency and reliability of software development processes.

I obtained my **M.Sc.** degree in Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence at [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/), Orsay, France in 2021, under the guidance of [Prof. dr. Isabelle Guyon](https://guyon.chalearn.org/). Before that, I graduated with a **B.S.** degree in Opto-electronic Information Science and Engineering at [Huazhong University of Science and Technology(HUST)](http://english.hust.edu.cn/), Wuhan, China in 2018.
