It has been observed that when automated workflow execution fails, developers sometimes only rerun the workflow or failed job without any modifications to the repository. The widespread use of these reruns has consumed considerable computing resources and raised concerns regarding the reliability and consistency of these workflows. Understanding how developers rerun GitHub Actions workflows and the rationale behind the rerun can provide valuable insights to further improve the reliability and efficiency of the software development process.In this work, we conducted an empirical study on 3,320 open-source Java repositories to understand how developers rerun GitHub Actions workflows and quantify both wasted time and computing resources. We further studied the cases where workflow reruns lead to successful outcomes and manually analyzed the reasons behind the workflow execution flakiness. Based on our findings, we tested four machine learning based models to predict the workflow execution outcome, aiming to reduce the potential resource waste caused by workflow reruns. Our study presents how developers deal with GitHub Actions execution failures, pinpoints root causes of workflow execution flakiness, and offers actionable insights to improve CI/CD workflow reliability and efficiency.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2025</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge"><a href="https://conf.researchr.org/home/icpc-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ICPC2025</a></abbr></div> <div id="Huang2025a" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Revisiting Security Practices for GitHub Actions Workflows</div> <div class="author"> Jiangnan Huang, and Bin Lin</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>In Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Program Comprehension</em> Feb 2025 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/Huang2025a.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/jiangnanpro/Security-of-GHA-workflow" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>GitHub Actions, a built-in CI/CD service of GitHub released in 2019, has become one of the most widely adopted tools among developers for automating software development workflows. This popularity, however, brings security challenges, as vulnerable workflows can expose repositories and the software supply chains to significant risks. Existing studies have highlighted several types of potential security issues. Over the past few years, GitHub has been constantly promoting better security practices and developers have gained experience in using GitHub Actions. Investigating how developers’ practices for handling GitHub Actions security have changed over time could offer valuable insights for further strengthening the security of these workflows. In this study, we analyzed non-optimal security practices in 18,938 workflows from 5,246 active GitHub repositories. By comparing the prevalence of issues spotted in two different years (2022 and 2024), we find that some undesired practices still widely exist in repositories. However, some progress has been observed, such as the significant reduce of permission misconfigurations.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge"><a href="https://dl.acm.org/journal/tosem" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TOSEM</a></abbr></div> <div id="10.1145/3749371" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Why Do GitHub Actions Workflows Fail?

Despite its popularity, failures frequently occur during GHA workflow executions. Fixing these failures often requires significant human effort, and unsuccessful workflow executions waste computing resources. Understanding the reasons behind workflow failures could provide valuable insights for troubleshooting the existing issues of CI/CD and further improving the development process.In this paper, we present an empirical study to reveal the reasons behind GHA workflow failures. By manually analyzing 375 failed workflow executions across 260 open-source Java projects, we built a comprehensive taxonomy categorizing the common failure types. The taxonomy was further validated by surveying 151 developers. This study is the first empirical work to analyze GHA workflow failures, bringing valuable knowledge to the field of continuous integration in software engineering. Moreover, our taxonomy and survey results not only underscore the critical need for better tools and practices to mitigate these failures but also indicate the directions to enhance the efficiency and reliability of CI/CD pipelines.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="year">2023</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge"><a href="https://www.ieee-scam.org/2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SCAM2023</a></abbr></div> <div id="a89159487haha" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">CIGAR: Contrastive Learning for GitHub Action Recommendation</div> <div class="author"> Jiangnan Huang, and Bin Lin</div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Source Code Analysis and Manipulation (Best paper award)</em> Jul 2023 </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/2023206389.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> <a href="https://github.com/jiangnanpro/CIGAR" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>GitHub Actions was introduced in 2019 as an integrated solution for CI/CD to automate software development workflow. Since then, it has gained tremendous popularity among developers. In a GitHub Actions workflow, actions refer to custom applications for performing complex but frequently repeated tasks. Actions can be typically found in GitHub Marketplace or public GitHub repositories. Prior studies have already disclosed that developers often reuse actions to reduce double work and improve productivity. However, it is not trivial for developers, especially novices, to figure out which action to reuse due to the large number of actions available and the limited search functionality GitHub Marketplace provides. To address this issue, we propose CIGAR (ContrastIve learning for GitHub Action Recommendation). Given the textual description of a task developers want to execute, CIGAR will recommend the most relevant actions. CIGAR exploits a pre-trained RoBERTa model to convert sequences of words into high-dimensional vector representations, and is fine tuned through a contrastive learning objective. The performance of CIGAR was evaluated on a novel dataset curated based on prior research, and the results demonstrate that CIGAR can reliably recommend actions needed by developers and significantly outperforms the GitHub Marketplace search engine. Our study indicates the promise of employing contrastive learning for GitHub action recommendation. The promising performance achieved can potentially drive a wider adoption of GitHub Actions and facilitate the automation of software development workflows.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li></ol> <h2 class="year">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"><li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"><abbr class="badge"><a href="https://www.mdpi.com/journal/algorithms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Algorithms</a></abbr></div> <div id="a15070254" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">LTU Attacker for Membership Inference</div> <div class="author"> Joseph Pedersen, Rafael Muñoz-Gómez, Jiangnan Huang, and <span class="more-authors" title="click to view 3 more authors" onclick=" var element=$(this); element.attr('title', ''); var more_authors_text=element.text() == '3 more authors' ?

The Defender aims at optimizing a dual objective: utility and privacy. Privacy is evaluated with the membership prediction error of a so-called “Leave-Two-Unlabeled” LTU Attacker, having access to all of the Defender and Reserved data, except for the membership label of one sample from each, giving the strongest possible attack scenario. We prove that, under certain conditions, even a “naïve” LTU Attacker can achieve lower bounds on privacy loss with simple attack strategies, leading to concrete necessary conditions to protect privacy, including: preventing over-fitting and adding some amount of randomness. This attack is straightforward to implement against any model trainer, and we demonstrate its performance against MemGaurd. However, we also show that such a naïve LTU Attacker can fail to attack the privacy of models known to be vulnerable in the literature, demonstrating that knowledge must be complemented with strong attack strategies to turn the LTU Attacker into a powerful means of evaluating privacy. The LTU Attacker can incorporate any existing attack strategy to compute individual privacy scores for each training sample. Our experiments on the QMNIST, CIFAR-10, and Location-30 datasets validate our theoretical results and confirm the roles of over-fitting prevention and randomness in the algorithms to protect against privacy attacks.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@article</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">a15070254</span><span class="p">,</span>

Standard local search approaches, PAM and Lloyd’s heuristics, are investigated in the 2D PF case to solve faster large instances. Specific initialization strategies related to 2D PF cases are implemented with the generic ones (Forgy’s, Hartigans, k-means++). Applying PAM and Lloyd’s local search iterations, the quality of local minimums are compared with optimal values. Numerical results are computed using generated instances, which were made public. This study highlights that local minimums of a poor quality exist for 2D PF cases. A parallel or multi-start heuristic using four initialization strategies improves the accuracy to avoid poor local optimums. Perspectives are still open to improve local search heuristics for the specific 2D PF cases.</p> </div> <div class="bibtex hidden"> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bibtex" data-lang="bibtex"><span class="nc">@inproceedings</span><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">10.1007/978-3-030-85672-4_2</span><span class="p">,</span>
